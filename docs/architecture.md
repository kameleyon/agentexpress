# AgentExpress Project Architecture

## Overview

AgentExpress is a platform designed to democratize access to AI technology through a "plug-n-play" approach. The platform consists of both a web application and a mobile app, providing a unified experience across devices.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modern, scalable architecture with the following components:

### Frontend

1. **Web Application**
   - Framework: React with Next.js
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
   - State Management: Zustand for global state
   - Data Fetching: React Query for server state management
   - Routing: Next.js App Router

2. **Mobile Application**
   - Framework: Expo (React Native)
   - Navigation: React Navigation
   - UI Components: Custom components with shared design system
   - State Management: Same as web (Zustand)

### Backend

1. **API Layer**
   - Framework: Node.js with Express
   - API Style: RESTful with JSON
   - Authentication: JWT with Supabase Auth

2. **Database**
   - Primary Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
   - Vector Database: Pinecone (for AI embeddings)
   - Caching: Redis

3. **AI Services**
   - LLM Integration: OpenAI API, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude
   - Vector Embeddings: OpenAI Embeddings
   - Media Processing: Various specialized APIs

### Infrastructure

1. **Hosting**
   - Web Frontend: Vercel
   - API: Vercel Serverless Functions
   - Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

2. **DevOps**
   - CI/CD: GitHub Actions
   - Monitoring: Sentry for error tracking
   - Analytics: Google Analytics, Mixpanel

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the frontend (web or mobile)
2. Frontend makes API calls to the backend services
3. Backend processes requests, interacts with databases and external AI services
4. Results are returned to the frontend for display
5. Analytics and monitoring track system performance and user behavior

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure credential storage

2. **Data Protection**
   - Data encryption in transit (HTTPS)
   - Data encryption at rest
   - Regular security audits

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - CORS configuration

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless API design for easy scaling
   - Database connection pooling
   - Caching strategy for frequently accessed data

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - CDN for static assets
   - Optimized database queries
   - Efficient AI service usage

## Development Workflow

1. Local development environment
2. Testing in staging environment
3. Deployment to production
4. Monitoring and feedback loop

## System Dependencies

1. **External Services**
   - OpenAI API
   - Supabase
   - Stripe for payments
   - Various social media APIs

2. **Third-party Libraries**
   - See package.json for detailed dependencies

## Future Architectural Considerations

1. Microservices architecture for specific agent types
2. Edge computing for reduced latency
3. Advanced caching strategies
4. Multi-region deployment
