# AgentExpress Roadmap

## Introduction and Project Overview

AgentExpress is a cutting-edge platform designed to democratize access to AI technology through a "plug-n-play" approach. The platform enables businesses and individuals to implement pre-built AI agents with minimal customization, regardless of their technical expertise. Users can select agents for specific tasks (social media management, customer service, content creation, etc.), configure them with basic information, and deploy them immediately.

The core value proposition is simplifying AI implementation for everyday use cases, eliminating the need for coding, prompt engineering, or technical knowledge. By offering a subscription-based model with pricing tied to functionality, AgentExpress makes advanced AI capabilities accessible to small businesses, entrepreneurs, and individuals.

The platform will be developed as both a web application and a mobile app, providing a seamless, unified experience across devices with a futuristic yet clean aesthetic.

- Minimalist cards for each agent type with subtle hover effects
- Brief description of each agent's capabilities
- Visual representation of the agent's function (icons or illustrations)
- "Learn More" option for each agent type

### Social Proof Section
- Clean, minimal testimonial design
- Success metrics with animated counters
- Client logos in grayscale that gain color on hover

### Pricing Section
- Clean, transparent pricing cards
- Feature comparison in an easily scannable format
